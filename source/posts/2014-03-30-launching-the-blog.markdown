# Launching the blog

Hello, world!

Yes, I've finally gotten off my lazy arse and set it up. Many thanks go out to [willrax](http://twitter.com/willrax) for his easy to follow [blog post](http://blog.willrax.com/deploying-a-middleman-blog-to-github-pages/) which helped me get set up in around an hour. Thanks, buddy!

So, now that it's up, I am hoping to finally make some kind of contribution to the world by sharing the new things I learn and that might be useful to others.

Let's just see if that happens then ;)
