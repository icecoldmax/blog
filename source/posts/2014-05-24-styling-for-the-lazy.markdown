title: Styling for the lazy.
---
So a quick two months after setting this thing up, I finally got around to styling it. Sure I was lazy, but I DID try a couple of times,
only to get discouraged within minutes at my awful design skills. In the end I ~~stole~~ was inspired by
[Code For Australia's blog](http://blog.codeforaustralia.org) and based mine off that.
As you can probably tell, it uses good ol' [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/).

I guess the only thing now is to actually write a post about something I've learned.

Let... me... think...
